# Video Retargeting

This is an attempt to implement video retargeting techniques based on few research papers, specially the amazing work by Bo Yan, Senior Member, IEEE, Binhang Yuan, and Bo Yang (Effective Video Retargeting With Jittery Assessment).

Topics covered under this-
Saliency Map
Axis-aligned deformation
As-Rigid-As-Possible (ARAP) energy 
Motion Vectors
Temporal Coherency


For Saliency Map, we have used existing implementation of Ittiâ€™s algorithm by Akisato Kimura
(pySaliencyMap.py and pySaliencyMapDefs.py. Please check the below link for his full work-
